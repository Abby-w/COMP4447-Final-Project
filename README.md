## Dataset 
This dataset came from an online survey at askamanager.org (https://www.askamanager.org/2021/04/how-much-money-do-you-make-4.html) . The goal of this survey was to take the mystery out of salaries and allow people to see how much others were actually making. There are 17 variables consisting of:

## Research Question
How accurately can salary be predicted based on the features in this dataset? What are the best predictors of salary? 

## Literature review (2 points)
- What other work has been done in this area, and how is your work novel compared to others?

## Quality of cleaning (6 points, 2 points each)
- Data cleaning and type conversion activity. Please share anything unusual you faced during this activity.
- What did you do about missing values and why? Handling missing values properly is very important.
- New feature/attribute creation and data summary statistics and interpretation.

## Visualization (8 points, 2 points each)
- Data visualization activity (box plot, bar plot, violin plot, and pairplot to see relationships and distribution, etc.).
- Describe anything you find in the data after each visualization.
- What data visualization helped you understand about data distribution.
- What you did about possible outlier as per data distribution visualization. (Did you confirm with your client whether it is actually an outlier or put a disclosure statement in your notebook if you decided to remove it?)
